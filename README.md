# testability-kata in C# (.NET Core)
A kata that I use to teach people how to convert legacy non-testable code to 100% testable code. The different branches contain different "phases". The last phase has all tests implemented.

This kata does not teach about test conventions like AAA (Arrange Act Assert) or how to name your tests. It doesn't dictate whether to use BDD (Business Driven Development) style testing or similar. You still have to agree on your team how to structure that. The kata focuses on the "universal" things that apply to all systems and all teams.

**This is not a clean code kata! Please note that the code is far from production code, and is "weird" and "ugly" on purpose for demonstrating testability alone. Yes, clean code goes in hand with testable code, but I have decided to only clean up the minimal amount to still be able to demonstrate testability. I may decide to make a clean code kata later.**

# Excercises
These excercises are carefully thought through to allow them to be used on real existing systems too (just follow the steps below on any system, and you'll have a testable system).

## Making the system testable with non-intrusive changes
First we need to make our system testable, and the key point here is that all of the below changes can be performed in a non-intrusive manner (so that we don't break anything).

_As a result of this, the code will look "odd" and perhaps even bad in some areas, but this is temporary (we'll get back to cleaning up in later steps once we have coverage)._

To see the original non-testable code: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/blob/master/src/TestabilityKata/Program.cs

**Important notes before you throw up**
- Yes, there are magic strings several places. This is on purpose to make the kata small and easy to understand. This kata demonstrates testability, not clean code.
- No, we don't log exception details in the `Logger`. This is not supposed to be a real "production-ready" logger. It is just a class demonstrating testability, and is by no means ready for production code.
- Yes, all classes are defined in one file. Again, to make it easier to understand for everyone - not recommended for production code.
- Yes, we instantiate a `CustomFileWriter` per `Logger.Log` call because the file name of the `CustomFileWriter` is based on the log level given as argument to that method, and because the `CustomFileWriter` requires it in its constructor. This could easily be optimized away, but the point of this code is again to demonstrate testability in all aspects and _object composition_ that could be found in production.

### Step 1. Get rid of static sickness (convert statics to non-statics)
This allows objects to actually have some form of "state" that is scoped to themselves and their own lifetime rather than being application-scoped. Essentially a static class is just "some functions and some global state operating somewhere" in your program. Statics also rarely actually save a lot of lines of code, and they can't be faked out.

_If your static dependency has too many references, it can be hard to "just" convert into non-statics. In this case, take your existing static method (let's say it's called `SendMail`) and rename it into `SendMailStatic` so that all references will point to this method for backward compatibility. Then take the body of this method and move it into a new non-static method called `SendMail`. Finally, change the `SendMailStatic` method so that it instantiates a new instance of itself and calls the non-static `SendMail` function on that instance. This allows you to take "baby steps" in getting rid of static sickness instead of doing it all. Just remember that static functions can't be faked out._

**Important notes before you throw up**
- This is a temporary step - don't worry. We will clean up later.

### Step 2. Apply manual dependency injection to non-static class dependencies where only one instance of a dependency per class is required
Doing this is part of following the Open/Closed principle (the "O" in SOLID). By injecting dependencies in from the outside, we essentially allow tests to "fake out" the "internals" of our class if they want to, and provide their own versions of dependencies for this class. As an example, it allows us to provide our own `Logger` for our `Program`, or our own `MailSender` for our `Logger`, even if `Logger` or `MailSender` was a third party NuGet package that we couldn't change.

_Note that the `Logger`'s `CustomFileWriter` class dependency has not been converted yet in this step - that will be done in the next step, since the constructor parameter for file name depends on the log level, which is only available by the time the `Log` method is called._

### Step 3. Apply manual dependency injection via factories for scenarios where creation of objects at runtime is required
This is about continuing step 2, but for the `Logger`'s `CustomFileWriter` dependency. Since it is created in the `Log` method and the file name to log to depends on the log level given in this method, we can't just inject a `CustomFileWriter` into the constructor. Here, we instead create a `CustomFileWriterFactory` which we then inject, and this factory then injects the dependencies required for creating a `CustomFileWriter`.

To see this change: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/compare/step-2...step-3

**Important notes before you throw up**
- Yes, we create a whole `CustomFileWriterFactory` here to create `CustomFileWriter` instances. We could have used a `Func<T>`, but I wanted this code to be readable and understandable by all levels of programming. Once again, this kata focuses on testability, not clean code.

### Step 4. Extract interfaces from classes and rely on what objects "do" - not what they "are"
This is about applying the Dependency Inversion principle (the D in SOLID) and making our program more losely coupled. A dependency declared as a class is tightly coupled to "what that class is" (for instance that it's a `Tiger` class). If it was declared as an interface instead - for instance `IAnimal` which then had a `Bite` method, then it would instead just be coupled to "something that can bite".

Within testability this allows us to make "fake" implementations of dependencies (for instance, a fake `MailSender` which doesn't actually send e-mails when running unit tests). More on this later when we get to writing the tests.

To see this change: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/compare/step-3...step-4

**Important notes before you throw up**
- Yes, while following the Dependency Inversion principle, we don't follow it _exactly_ by the book here. If we did, we most likely would compose many small interfaces per class, that each defines the minimum methods that make that interface live up to its responsibility. Once again, this is not the case because I wanted the kata to be readable and focus on testability, not necessarily clean code. The important part for the testability here is to be backed by interfaces - not that they are small and clean. Besides, the classes we are dealing with are small in the first place, and may not make sense to split up.

## Testing the system
It should be noted that these tests only focus on the "unique" scenarios where something needs to be handled differently from step to step. In general, both negative and positive outcomes of tests (throwing exceptions and/or passing) and most input scenarios should be tested.

### Unit testing the `Program` class
This class is relatively important to have coverage on, as it is our main program. Similarly, it's a good idea to determine _the right areas to test_. Code coverage is not everything. It can be a distraction.

#### Step 5. Test that the program sends an e-mail about it starting, when it starts up
Technically here we could create our own `FakeEmailSender` class, pass it to our `Program` instance when instantiating it, and then having this `FakeEmailSender` report what arguments its `SendMail` method was called with, and pass the test if these arguments are correct and the method was indeed called.

However, for now we will skip all this and use `NSubstitute`, which can magically at runtime (it uses the `TypeBuilder` class in C# for this) create a new class that implements a given interface, and record calls and change its runtime behavior.

So to summarize, this step is about making a fake `IEmailSender` at runtime using `NSubstitute`, passing this into the `Program` instance as a dependency, and then (after executing `Program.Run()`), we check that the `IEmailSender.SendMail` method was called with the right arguments.

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

To see this change: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/compare/step-4...step-5

#### Step 6. Test that the program logs an error if one of its dependencies throws one on startup
Similarly to step 5, we here need to have `NSubstitute` create a fake dependency which throws an exception. We then run the program, and need to make sure that the `Logger`'s `Log` method was called with a log level of `Error`.

_Pro-tip: Similarly to how `NSubstitute` allows you to see if a specific method was called, it can also check if a method was *not* called. It would be a good idea to also cover the negative cases (testing that the `Log` method is *not* called when we *don't* throw an error), but we are skipping that for now._

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

### Unit testing the `MailSender` class
It turns out that this class has no dependencies and was already testable all along - so this should be easy. No faking required here.

#### Step 7. Test that the mail sender throws an exception if the e-mail is invalid (doesn't contain a `@`)
Here we can just invoke the method directly and put an `ExpectedExceptionAttribute` on our test to describe that it should _pass_ instead of failing when a specific exception is thrown.

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

To see this change: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/compare/step-6...step-7

### Integration testing the `CustomFileWriter` class
The reason we call this an integration test (even if we fake out the `EmailSender`), is because the `CustomFileWriter` actually accesses the file system. If we wanted to fake the file system out as well, we could make our own `CustomFile` class instead of the `System.IO.File` static reference. However, it is also important to remember that too many abstractions can lead to _low code readability_, which is very bad and often worse than the extra coverage we miss out on.

It is important to note that an integration test focuses more on testing a "feature" than testing a "specific function or unit". Therefore, instead of tests called `CallingSignUpInvokesMailSenderToSendActivationEmail`, we may have tests that look at it from a feature or business perspective, such as `WhenISignUpIGetAnActivationEmail`.

#### Step 8. Test that the custom file writer sends an e-mail out when it has created a new file
Since we have decided not to make our own fakeable `System.IO.File` decorator, we have to make a test here that makes sure the file actually doesn't exist on disk before appending lines to it, to see if an e-mail is being sent out. We still need a fake `MailSender` for this though.

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

## Cleaning up the code

**Important notes before you throw up**
- In this phase we don't clean up the magic strings or optimize the program flow. This is on purpose, to keep the kata very small and understandable. We're not trying to teach clean code - we're trying to teach testability.
- The steps below focus on cleaning the test code primarily, not the code of the main program as much.

### Step 9. Re-use the "setup code" for all tests so that fakes are defined as fields on the test class
In each test we are faking out several things and repeating ourselves over and over, violating the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). We should unify the generic setup logic for each test into a test initialization method.

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

To see this change: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/compare/step-8...step-9

### Step 10. Introduce an IOC (Inversion of Control) container for automatic dependency injection
For this, step I recommend `Autofac`. Have `Autofac` register specific interfaces as specific implementations (you can do this manually for each type or automatically for all types in the assembly), and have your brand new IOC container construct your `Program` instead - injecting all of its dependencies automatically. Also modify the tests so that they use the IOC container for their types too. **At first, this may seem counter-productive. We will see why it makes sense in step 11.**

_Note that the configuration of `Autofac` should ideally be turned into an `Autofac` module, so that it can be re-used by your test projects See the changeset below if you are in doubt of what this means._

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

To see this change: https://github.com/ffMathy/testability-kata/compare/step-9...step-10

### Step 11. Introduce `FluffySpoon.Testing.Autofake` for automatic dependency faking
**Documentation:** https://github.com/ffMathy/FluffySpoon.Testing

By introducing auto-faking and extracting the logic for creating the container into a separate class, we can automatically scan for a class' dependencies in the constructor and register them as fakes. This is great, because if a new dependency is added to a class, our existing tests won't break, and they will still compile.

_You may think "why are we automatically faking all dependencies? What if I want to test the interaction between a class and its real dependencies?" - well, in that case we're talking about an integration test, and not a unit test. Autofaking is *not* useful for integration tests._

*After this step, run all tests to make sure you haven't broken anything.*

# Other information

## SOLID within testability

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**TL;DR:** Classes should do just one thing. Make sure your classes _only have one reason to change_.

**Testability aspect:** Decreases the amount of tests that need to be written to test the same things. Reduces duplication. Reduces chance of tests breaking over time when your system changes.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**TL;DR:** Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification. You should be able to control "how" a class uses its dependencies without changing that class' code.

**Testability aspect:** Allows us to fake dependencies of a class, and recording the class' usage of these dependencies in unit tests. This way, we only test the "unit" itself, and not everything it interacts with - this would be covered by individual unit tests as well.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**TL;DR:** We should be able to substitute any object with a different object implementing the same interface, without causing nasty side-effects. _If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs batteries, you probably have the wrong abstraction_.

**Testability aspect:** This makes it possible for us to substitute and fake any dependency of a class, and count on that it won't change the flow of the program into something bad.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**TL;DR:** An interface should have as few methods and properties as possible, while still living up to its responsibility. A lot of small interfaces is often easier to test than a few large ones - and a class can implement many interfaces.

**Testability aspect:** More atomic interfaces may lead to more atomic tests. We can also decide to remove an interface implementation from an object without it requiring a big redesign of our tests.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**TL;DR:** A class should not care about what its dependencies "are", but what they "do". Depend on interfaces (what something "does"), not classes (what something "is").

**Testability aspect:** By depending on interfaces (something that "does" something) we can substitute that functionality out and fake it for a class' dependencies.

## Beware of inheritance
Inheritance (especially used entirely for code-reuse and not polymorphism) can potentially break a large part of the SOLID principles (except Open/Closed principle, which can be based on inheritance), and make your code harder to test. 

A classic example is having some `UserService` which inherits from a `BaseService` to re-use methods that are defined on that base service. The reason this _can be_ bad for testability is that if you have 100 services and need to test them all, then all of the functionality defined in `BaseService` would have to be faked out and configured for all these 100 tests. 

Instead, you could use composition (which by the way only makes you spend one extra line of code). This lets you make a test for `BaseService` separately, and then only focus on testing the things that are unique to the individual services on top of that.

_Note that this only applies if your base class is only there for code-reuse and not polymorphism. If extracting the class into a separate class would break encapsulation by making your protected fields public or if the base class is small enough, it may not worth it._

More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance

### Example of inheritance
Here we have the `BaseMethod` defined on `Bar` for quick code-reuse. For each test we would now have to fake out and configure `BaseMethod` for all of our tests.

```csharp
public class Foo: Bar {
  public void MainMethod() {
    base.BaseMethod();
  }
}

public class Bar {
  public void BaseMethod() { }
}
```

### Example of inheritance converted to composition
Note how we only lose very few lines of code! Think about this for a second - not bad for a more losely coupled system.

```csharp
public class Foo
{
  Bar bar;
  
  public Foo(Bar bar) {
    this.bar = bar;
  }

  public void MainMethod() {
    bar.BaseMethod();
  }
}

public class Bar {
  public void BaseMethod() { }
}
```

## UI tests vs integration tests vs unit tests
The higher we go abstraction wise, the more maintenance is required (they get more fragile to changes), the slower the tests run and the more time they take to build and get running. However, unit tests don't make integration tests obsolete or the other way around. Both are needed to gain a healthy coverage in your system.
